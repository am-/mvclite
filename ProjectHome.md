MVCLite is a PHP-project which tries to provide the most essential features for a website. Especially MVC is needed for this goal. Additionally, MVC Lite supports basic solutions which are easily extensible. Furthermore additional aims are easy understanding, transparency and good support for testing.

If some applications get richer of features it can be necessary to change to a real, sophisticated MVC-framework. In the final phase of this project this need is adopted.
